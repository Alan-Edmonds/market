#things to look at:
#   open interest of option vs stock volume
#   price movement of the stock itself: can look at strangles of a certain %otm, and see how, for example, a 10%otm strangle on 5/08 cost vs 10%otm strangle on 6/08 for a company with earnings on 6/09
#   standard to be compared to should be a comparable spy/vix/qqq strangle on the same time frame.
#   can also look at how a specific strangle performed from 5/08 to 6/08 without taking all factors into account (keeping strike prices the same throughout, maybe even for a stock with lots of price movement leading up to earnings)
#   in the end, try to use intractable algos to find ways for predicting which stocks will experience the best iv surges before earnings. will have to use lots of relevant data, possibly including price movement of stock leading
#       up to earnings, volume of stock, open interest of stock contracts vs normal stock volume, short interest, general state of market/vix, 'hype level' of the stock (how big of a name it is, media attention/twitter mentions?),
#   Even further, it will benefit to know which strangle will work best. For example, sometimes a close atm strangle doesn't gain much leading up to earnings but the far otm strangle gains immensely, or vice versa.
#       to build upon that, we can go further by not looking just at %otm but also at expiry dates. Maybe even will be able to identify if a certain expiry date's volatility hasnt caught up with the rest of the options and is
#       thus underpriced. For example, maybe earnings are on july1st, and the july10 options have increased by 50% in past weeek, but july17 options only increased by 30%
